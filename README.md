# sensor-monitor-esp32
Home automation project for collecting and transmitting sensor data from esp32 microcontrollers.

### Usage
Sketch files can be uploaded to esp32 microcontrollers with the help of Arduino IDE. Note that after the code is compiled and it is trying to connect to the microcontroller through a COM port, the 'IO' button should be pressed until it finds the device.

#### Lib
In order to use 3rd party libraries in the sketch file (e.g. user made libraries), the desired libraries need to be copied into the lib folder inside arduino's home folder (can be found in the options inside Arduino IDE).
